This application is designed for Romanian law graduates to prepare for both the Bar Exam (Barou) and the Judiciary Exam (INM).

Built with ReactJS, the app provides access to 100-question practice tests sourced directly from the official INM and Barou websites, based on previous years' exams. After completing a test, users can check their results to see how many questions they answered correctly. For any incorrect responses, the correct answers are provided, helping users learn and improve their performance.
